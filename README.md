Integrate SENNA v3.0 into GATE

This is a java wrapper to execute SENNA (https://ronan.collobert.com/senna/), parse the STDOUT and add annotations to GATE as a Processing Resource.

It does not bundle SENNA, as it has its own license (see https://ronan.collobert.com/senna/license.html).

## Installation
see [wiki](https://github.com/aaron-sr/gateplugin-SennaAdapter/wiki/Installation)
